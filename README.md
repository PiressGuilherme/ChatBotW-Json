# ChatBotW-Json

### This code is a simple chatbot implemented in Python, which uses a JSON file as a knowledge base to answer user questions. Here's a brief explanation of what each part does and how you can use it.

## Importing Libraries:
The code imports the json and get_close_matches libraries from the standard Python library. json is used to handle JSON files, while get_close_matches is used to find questions similar to those provided by users.
## Function loadknowledge:
This function takes the path to a JSON file as input and returns the data contained in that file as a Python dictionary.
## Function saveknowledge:
This function takes a file path and a dictionary as input and saves the dictionary to the specified JSON file.
## Function identify_best:
This function takes a user question and a list of known questions as input. It uses the get_close_matches function to find the most similar question to the one provided by the user.
## Function answer_to_question:
This function takes a question and the knowledge base as input. It looks for the question in the knowledge base and returns the corresponding answer, if it exists.
## Function chat_bot:
This is the main function of the chatbot. It loads the knowledge base, starts the conversation loop with the user, and responds to questions or learns new answers if it doesn't know how to respond.
## How to use:
To use this code in Google Colaboratory, you need to have a JSON file with the knowledge base and upload that file to the Colab environment.
You can add a code cell in Colab and paste this code.
Make sure the JSON file of the knowledge base is in the same directory as your Colab notebook.
Run the notebook cells, and the chatbot will be started.
You can interact with the chatbot by providing questions and receiving corresponding answers. If the chatbot doesn't know how to respond, it will ask you to teach it a new answer.
